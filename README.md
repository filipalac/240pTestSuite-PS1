240p Test Suite
===============

The [240p test suite] is a homebrew software suite for video game
consoles developed to help in the evaluation of upscalers, upscan
converters and line doublers.

It has tests designed with the processing of 240p signals in mind,
although when possible it includes other video modes and specific
tests for them.  These have been tested with video processors on
real hardware and a variety of displays, including CRTs and Arcade
monitors via RGB.

As a secondary target, the suite aims to provide tools for
calibrating colors, black and white levels for specific console
outputs and setups. 

This is free software, with full source code available under the GPL.
